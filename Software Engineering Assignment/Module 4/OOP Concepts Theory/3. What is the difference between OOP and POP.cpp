* What is the difference between OOP and POP?

ANS-->>

The main differences between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and
Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP), are:
	
	1. Program Structure:

	OOP: Organizes the program around objects, which are instances of classes.
	POP: Organizes the program as a sequence of procedures or functions.
	
	2. Data and Functions:

	OOP: Combines data and the functions that operate on that data into objects.
	POP: Keeps data and functions separate.

	3. Data Access:

	OOP: Data is typically hidden (encapsulated) and accessed through methods.
	POP: Data is openly accessible to the whole program.

	4. Code Reusability:

	OOP: Achieves reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.
	POP: Achieves reusability mainly through functions.

	5. Data Security:

	OOP: Provides better data security through encapsulation and data hiding.
	POP: Has less data security as data is more openly accessible.

	6. Modularity:

	OOP: Highly modular, with each object forming a distinct unit.
	POP: Less modular, often resulting in "spaghetti code" in complex programs.

	7. Problem-Solving Approach:

	OOP: Focuses on creating objects that contain both data and functions.
	POP: Focuses on creating functions that perform operations on data.

	8. Real-World Mapping:

	OOP: Easier to map to real-world problems and entities.
	POP: Can be less intuitive for modeling complex real-world scenarios.

	9. Learning Curve:

	OOP: Generally has a steeper learning curve due to more complex concepts.
	POP: Usually easier to learn and understand for beginners.

	10. Examples of Languages:

	OOP: Java, C++, Python, Ruby
	POP: C, Pascal, Fortran

Both paradigms have their strengths and are suited for different types of problems.
OOP is often preferred for large, complex programs, while POP can be more
straightforward for smaller, linear tasks.
