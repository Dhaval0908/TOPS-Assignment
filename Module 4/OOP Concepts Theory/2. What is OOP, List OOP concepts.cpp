* What is OOP? List OOP concepts

ANS-->>

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
It's a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects,"
which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or
properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

Here are the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming:
	
	1. Classes: Templates or blueprints for creating objects. 
	They encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.
	
	2. Objects: Instances of classes. 
	They are the basic units of OOP and represent real-world entities.
	
	3. Encapsulation: The bundling of data and the methods that operate
	on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to
	some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental
	interference and misuse of the methods and data.
	
	4. Inheritance: A mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an
	existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This promotes
	code reuse and establishes a relationship between parent and child classes.
	
	5. Polymorphism: The ability of different classes to be treated as
	instances of the same class through inheritance. It allows one interface
	to be used for a general class of actions.
	
	6. Abstraction: The process of hiding the complex reality while exposing
	only the necessary parts. It reduces programming complexity and effort.
	
	7. Message Passing: The process by which an object sends data to
	another object or asks another object to invoke a method.
	
	8. Aggregation and Composition: Special forms of association. 
	Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently
	of the parent. Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot
	exist independent of the parent.
	
These concepts form the core of object-oriented programming and are implemented
in various OOP languages like C++, Java, Python, and others. They help in
creating more organized, flexible, and maintainable code.
